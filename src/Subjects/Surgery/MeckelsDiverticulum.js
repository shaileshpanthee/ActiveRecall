Introduction:
• It is the most common congenital anomaly of small intestine
• Rule of 2:
\u00A0 a) 2 % prevalence
\u00A0 b) 2 inches in length
\u00A0 c) Half of symptomatic : <2yrs of age
\u00A0 d) Located: 2 feet proximal to ileocaecal valve
• It is True Diverticulum. It has all layers of bowel wall
• Located on Antimesenteric border of the ileum.
• Results from Incomplete closure of Omphalomesenteric or Vitellointestinal Duct
• Equal incidence in Male and Female.
• most common heterotropic tissue found? Gastric Mucosa (50%).

Clinical features:
- Most common clinical feature: GI bleeding
- Hemorrhage is manifested as Painless bright red blood from rectum.
- Source of bleeding is Ulcer in ileum adjacent to Meckel’s diverticulum that contains gastric mucosa (due to HCl exposure)
- Intestinal obstruction due to volvulus, intussusception

Most common complications:
a. In children: Bleeding
b. In adults: Intestinal obstruction

Investigation:
Most accurate diagnosis in children by : Scintigraphy

Treatment:
a) Diverticulectomy, ie resection of the segment of ileum bearing the diverticulum
b) Segmental intestinal resection is required for bleeding because bleeding site is usually in the ileum adjacent to the diverticulum.
c) Asymptomatic diverticulum found in age up to 80 years during laparotomy should be resected unless contraindicated.
